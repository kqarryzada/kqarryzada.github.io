                    I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2017 with an undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with focuses on Computer Architecture and Software Engineering. During my time there, I worked at

                    (also known as CHEDS), where I developed several programs used to obtain measurements and statuses of pressure gauges and gate valves.

The support cases I assist on involve a wide range of topics, including replication, certificate management issues, and tuning of configuration elements such as the JVM heap to improve performance of customer deployments. My favorite cases to work on typically involve lower-level concepts,
