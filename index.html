                    <p class="aboutMeText">
                    I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2017 with an undergraduate degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, with focuses on Computer Architecture and Software Engineering. During my time there, I worked at
                    <a href="http://texaspetawatt.ph.utexas.edu/" target="_blank">The Texas Petawatt Laser Lab</a>
                    (also known as CHEDS), where I developed several programs used to obtain measurements and statuses of pressure gauges and gate valves.

                    <p class="aboutMeText">
                    Currently, I'm working at
                    <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity</a>
                    as a sustaining engineer on the
                    <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/software-directory.html" target="_blank">PingDirectory</a>
                    team. The support cases I assist on involve a wide range of topics, including replication, JVM garbage collection, and tuning of configuration elements such as the heap to improve performance of customer deployments. My favorite cases to work on typically involve lower-level concepts, such as using memory analyzing tools to perform root cause analysis for memory leaks.

                    <p class="aboutMeText">
                    In my free time, I enjoy working on programming projects and playing video games. My favorite game of all time is Team Fortress 2.
